# Seller Mobile App
Seller Mobile App is an app that can be used by employees in various businesses to create orders for their customers. It also allows access to the list of all products/services offered by the business as well as their current availability in the store.
This app is a part of our school project and communicates directly with [Cash Register Server](https://github.com/spusina1/CashRegisterServer) in order to get required information.
